# Text Functions (with Spell Checking)

In this assignment we'll bring together a bunch of work we've done this semester, as well as add 
spell checking into the mix. 

At this point in the semester, we have four main tools we've built: 

1. Code that cleans and tokenizes text.
1. Code that identifies basic patterns in text.
1. Code that allows us to compare two groups of text.
1. Code that does basic spelling correction. 

In this assignment, I'd like you to modify a .py file that I've
built the stub for. The functions are listed in there with comments
that tell you what the function accepts for input and what it
returns for output. 

Then I've asked you to run your functions against a few NLTK data sets. 

## Side Note

We haven't talked about [docstrings](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/docstrings-python) in class. 
Learn what they are and notice that I've included them in several of the functions. We've been 
a bit lax on this kind of stuff this semester, but I'd strongly encourage you to follow 
the guidelines in section 3.8.1 of our [style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
