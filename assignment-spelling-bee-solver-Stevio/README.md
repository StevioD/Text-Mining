# Spelling Bee Solver

In this assignment, you'll build a solver for the NY Times Spelling Bee game. The rules of the
game are pretty simple: 

1. You're given 7 letters, one of which is required to appear in every solution word. 
2. Find as many words four letters or longer that use the seven letters. Every word must have the required letter in it.

We don't have a dictionary from the NY Times, so we're going to use two files (`big.txt` and `words-1.txt`) that are posted to Moodle. I've created a notebook as a starting point for you. Download the repo and download the zip with the word files. Extract those files into the same folder as the notebook to make it easier to read.

Submit your completed code and one screenshot of your results using the solver to get Genius on the game. 

Per a classmate, the Spelling Bee is partially paywalled. [Free Bee](https://freebee.fun/play/) seems like a decent potential substitute.
