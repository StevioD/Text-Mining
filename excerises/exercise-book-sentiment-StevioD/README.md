# Book Sentiment Exercise

In this exercise we'll recapitulate an 
[analysis](https://infogram.com/blog/scientists-use-big-data-to-discover-6-basic-emotional-story-arcs/) discussed 
in _Everybody Lies_. In this chapter Stephens-Davidowitz details an approach to measuring plots, looking at sentiment across a book. The authors of the original 
paper, which you read this week, posit six main plots:

1. Rags to Riches (rise)
1. Riches to Rags (fall)
1. Person in a hole (fall-rise)
1. Icarus (rise-fall)
1. Cinderella (rise-fall-rise)
1. Oedipus (fall-rise-fall)

In this notebook we'll pick a book or set of books from NLTK and do this. 
(Note that NLTK, by providing digitized copies of many books, has saved us a _lot_ of effort here.) 

I'm also including a notebook on using Naive Bayes for Sentiment Analysis. It doesn't have
any thing to do with the book sentiment, but it's a cool thing to check out.
